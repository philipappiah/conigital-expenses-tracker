Code challenge

You are tasked to build a tiny server to keep track of expenses. User must be able to submit their receipts to the server API, 
which will store those receipts in a database.

Each receipt must contain the following fields:
1. ID (string generated by the server/database; not part of input)
2. Category (string enum)
2.1. "Entertainment"
2.2. "Transport"
2.3. "Groceries"
2.4. "Shopping"
2.5. "Other"
3. Title (string)
4. Cost (number)
5. Time when added (ISO8601 compliant date-time string)

Every month, 2 spreadsheet must be produced:
1. A CSV file with all database entries, where each entry additionally shows percentage from total costs recorded for the period
2. A CSV file with all categories showing percentage of total cost per category
ry for the period

Requirements:
1. Server exposes REST API endpoints to:
1.1. Register new receipts
1.2. Get all receipts
1.3. Get receipt by its ID
1.4. An endpoint to read generated reports
2. OpenAPI v3 compliant specification, that describes REST API (can be generated or written manually; either host as interface or include YAML file in the repository)
3. Docker version of the server
4. Input validation

Caveats:
- Report generation period doesn't have to be set to 1 month. This is used to describe a real world scenario. The period should be configurable or hardcoded into source code
- Hosting is NOT required, but instructions to run everything are required (for both Docker and development server)
- Consider that only 1 user will be using the functionality
- Consider that the server does not require authentication
- CSV files must be created serverside at the scheduled moment and be accessible at any point
- The database must be wiped clean after both reports are generated
